## I'm Will Martin

- I'm from Norfolk, VA ← Atlanta, GA ← Hoschton, GA

- I am pursuing a master's degree in information science at Florida State University. I think that the world of libraries is deeply intertwined with the world of the web.

- I have a lot to learn—doing my best to improve every day.
