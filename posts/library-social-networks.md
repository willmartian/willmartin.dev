This isn't news, but the internet is kind of broken.

Mirroring other areas of life, power is concentrated in centralized, privately-owned silos. Search is dominated by Google. Social media is Facebook and Twitter. Email is more dispersed, but still widely owned and operated by private entities. 

Why is this the case? Once upon a time, critical services of society were delivered by public organizations. For example, mail is largley delivered by the United States Postal Service (for now, at least).

With the rapid rise of the internet and information and communication technologies, public organizations were replaced as stewards by private companies and Silicon Valley. However, the private ownership of these services has led to harmful side effects: algorithmic bias, unmoderated hate speech, excessive misinformation, frequent privacy breeches, and acts of censure. Acts to regulate said companies have been met with feeble arguments of... "Well, they are private companies, the platforms are their property."

Personally, I think such claims are bullshit. But I also think that trying to force companies to better manage these platforms and services is also bullshit--because it is too lukewarm.

Rather, we services that the public rely on should be managed by the public. Full stop. Silicon Valley's owernship of digital infrastructure should be viewed as temporary, not permanent, correct, or absolute.

And libraries are the perfect institutions to manage such services.

## Why Libraries?

Libraries are much more than shelves of books; they deal with *public access to information*. Traditionally, this may have looked like books (or scrolls), but the modern library also deals with information in the shape of videos, audio, files, eBooks, and so on. Libraries provide services to help patrons find infromation on the web or in specialized databases. Libraries house archives. Libraries hold seminars and classes. Many libraires are even digital-first, meaning they operate without an associated building or physical location.

Is it that big of a stretch to say that the massive amounts of infromation being generated on social networks should also be managed by the library? 

## Decentralized Computing and Federated Networks

Well, yes. It *is* a stretch to say that the typical library could manage the giant, complicated digital infrastructure of a giant centralized platform like Google or Twitter. **However, let me be frank: this is not the goal.** Replicating these giants outright would simply replicate many of the issues they have, even if it were managed by a library.

## Libraries as Social Networks

Rather than a giant centralized social network, libraries are well suited to host *decentralized social networks*. Decentralized social networks come in various forms, but a popular example is a federated social network:

Imagine for a second that the City A Library System had its own version of Twitter. Residents of City A could create an account, post tweets, follow other users--all the normal functionality of Twitter, but scoped to the City A community.  

Seeing all of the cool stuff happening on City A's local social network, City B Library System and City C Library System decided they want to start their own social networks as well. They do so--but now there is an issue. What if a community member wants to follow updates from all of the cities without creating multiples accounts? This is where *federating* comes into play. Instances of federated social networks can share information, allowing users to discover content even if it didn't originate in their city's instance. 

This isn't some far off technology. It is already a realized, open-source platform: Mastodon.
